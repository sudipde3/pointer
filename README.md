# Pointer
Use the concept of pointer to return more than one values from a function. 
For example: 
1. Print the value and address of a variable.
2. Print address of an Array and also compare it with the address of Arr[0];
3. Create a separate function which can compute min and max values of an array of numbers and call it 
inside the main() function. *Note we cannot return more than one value through a separate function, 
so for getting min and max using minMaxfun() you ave to use the concept of pointer (address of 
variable).
4. Create a separate function which should return normalized array (ArrN) for input of array (Arr) and 
call this inside the main() function. 
𝐴𝑟𝑟𝑁 = (𝐴𝑟𝑟 − 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑂𝑓𝐴𝑟𝑟)/𝑠𝑑𝑂𝑓𝐴𝑟𝑟;
5. *Note we cannot return array through a separate function, so for getting array output inside main 
function you have to use the concept of pointer (address of variable). 
𝐸𝑥: 𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑁𝑜𝑟𝐴𝑟𝑟(𝐴𝑟𝑟, 𝐴𝑟𝑟𝑁);
6. Create a separate function, which return diagonal entries of a Matrix and call it inside the main() 
function.
